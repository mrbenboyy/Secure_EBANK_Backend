# E-Bank Backend API
This is the backend API for an E-Bank application, built using Spring Boot. The API provides functionalities for managing customers, bank accounts, and account operations such as debit, credit, and transfer. It also includes authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Spring Security.

## Features
- **Customer Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve customer information.
- **Bank Account Management**: Create and manage current and savings accounts.
- **Account Operations**: Perform debit, credit, and transfer operations on bank accounts.
- **Account History**: Retrieve the transaction history of a bank account.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure endpoints using JWT and role-based access control.
- **Password Management**: Change password functionality with secure password encoding.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the application.
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure token-based authentication.
- **Hibernate**: For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and database interactions.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Database for storing application data.
- **Lombok**: For reducing boilerplate code.
- **Maven**: For dependency management.

## API Endpoints
